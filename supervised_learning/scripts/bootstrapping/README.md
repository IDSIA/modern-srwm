## Bootstrapped training

This directory contains example scripts for the paper: [Accelerating Neural Self-Improvement via Bootstrapping (ICLR 2023 Workshop)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SDwUYcyOCyP).

* Training: `train_miniimagenet_10shot_5bootstrap_srwm_conv4.sh`
* Evaluation: `15shot_eval_miniimagenet_10shot_5bootstrap_srwm_conv4.sh`
* Pre-trained model checkpoint (corresponding to the training script above; and used in the eval script above): `pretrained_miniimagenet_10shot_5bootstrap_srwm_conv4.pt`
